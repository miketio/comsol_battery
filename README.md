# COMSOL Battery Model

## Overview
This repository contains a COMSOL Multiphysics model for simulating the charge/discharge process of a battery, including the formation of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer. The model employs a 2-D original space and a 1-D pseudospace domain, using only mathematical and event modules. The battery charge process can be simulated with constant current, constant voltage, or a combination of both.

## Features
- **2-D Original Space and 1-D Pseudospace Domain**: Allows detailed simulation of battery processes.
- **Mathematical and Event Modules**: Utilized to model complex electrochemical phenomena.
- **Charge/Discharge Processes**:
  - Constant Current
  - Constant Voltage
  - Constant Current followed by Constant Voltage when the voltage is reached
- **SEI Layer Formation**: Simulates the formation and effects of the SEI layer during battery operation.

## Usage
### Requirements
- COMSOL Multiphysics software (version 5.4)
